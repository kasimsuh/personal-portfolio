# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site â€” built with just HTML and CSS. I followed a YouTube tutorial to get the structure down, but I actually understand what everything does and made a few changes to make it feel more like mine.

I used this project to practice working with real layouts, sections, and flexbox (which honestly made way more sense after building this). Itâ€™s fully responsive and gives a clean overview of who I am, what Iâ€™ve done so far, and how to reach me.

## Why I Made This

Iâ€™ve been learning front-end dev and wanted something that pulls everything together â€” structure, layout, responsiveness, and some design.

I didnâ€™t build this 100% from scratch, but I followed along with a tutorial, understood everything, debugged stuff on my own, and now I could recreate most of it without help. (Would I cry a bit? Maybe. But I could do it.)

## What I Learned

- Structuring multi-section web pages from scratch
- Flexbox layouts (and how to not break them ðŸ˜­)
- Managing spacing, alignment, and responsiveness
- Keeping CSS clean and organized
- The basics of creating a professional online presence
